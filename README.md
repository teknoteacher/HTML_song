To the tune of "YMCA" recorded by The Village People:

    Verse 1

    [Solo]
    Join me, as I share the history,
    of a young man, named Tim Berners-Lee
    At CERN, in the 1990s he,
    Invented the World-Wide-Web
    
    Verse 2

    [Solo]
    Tim knew, that the web should be free
    For always and everybody
    In hope that, all of humanity
    Could all work together
 
    [Chorus]
    The language of the web, HTML
    The language of the web, HTML
    You can code a web page
    No matter your age
    This was the mission of Tim BL
